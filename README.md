# Live!Data Smart Data Models Repository
This repository contains a collection of smart data models that have been customized and evolved to meet specific requirements based on the Smart Data Model Program. Each data model is designed to facilitate interoperability and standardization across various domains, enabling seamless integration and management of data for applications and services.

## Overview
The Smart Data Model Program provides a standardized framework for data models across different sectors, including IoT, smart cities, and more. This repository builds on those existing models, evolving them to meet custom requirements unique to our projects. These custom models are structured to support extended attributes, enhanced validation rules, and optimized formats for efficient data handling.

## Repo Structure
The structure is also based on the Smart Data Model repo with the lower level repository being a subject (i.e. Alert, Streetlighting, etc). Every 
subject repository is then aggregated into domain repositories.


## Context Generator tool 
The repo also contains at the base level a context generation tool used whenever a new data model is added to a certain domain. This generator has been provided by the Fiware open source platform and it can be accessed [HERE](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Understanding-At-Context/tree/NGSI-LD?tab=readme-ov-file#autogenerating-context-files-from-swagger).
